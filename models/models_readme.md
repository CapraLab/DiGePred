DiGePred has been trained using digenic pairs from DIDA (Gazzo et al., 2016; http://dida.ibsquare.be) and non-digenic pairs from various sources.

  unaffected: non-digenic pairs derived from unaffected relatives of individuals with rare undiagnosed diseases, as part of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.
  permuted: non-digenic pairs derived from permutations of genes from digenic pairs in DIDA.
  random: non-digenic pairs generated randomly.
  matched: non-digenic pairs chosen to match the distribution of features of digenic pairs.
  unaffected no gene overlap: unaffected non-digenic pairs chosen such that no genes were common between the training and held-out test sets.  
  random no gene overlap: random non-digenic pairs chosen such that no genes were common between the training and held-out test sets.
