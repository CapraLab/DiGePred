The features used to characterize each gene pair to train DiGePred were: 
common_phenotypes: Jaccard similarity of phenotypes associated with both genes. (https://hpo.jax.org/app/) 
#ofphenotypes_combined: Quadratic mean of number of phenotypes associated with each gene.

a python dictionary for a gene to all associated HPO phenotype codes is available.
